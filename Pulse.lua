-- The pulse: the moment one of your cooldowns comes back, its icon pulses in
-- the middle of your screen: big and a little see-through, in fast, a short
-- hold, then out, growing as it goes. Several at once take turns, and only a
-- few wait, so it never floods. On from the start, ticked on or off on the
-- Cooldown pulse page in /fecp (PulsePage.lua); with Forever Enhanced
-- Cooldown Manager's own pulse on, that one runs instead (Link.lua). Each
-- cooldown pulses in one of two styles, Quick or Long, each with its own
-- size, time and sound. The same pulse as Forever Enhanced Cooldown
-- Manager's Cooldown pulse page.
--
-- Cooldowns are secret in a fight, so nothing here reads one. Each spell
-- watched has a Cooldown frame of its own that's never drawn, handed the
-- game's duration object, and the game itself says when it's done
-- (OnCooldownDone): that's the pulse. The global cooldown is left out by
-- asking for the duration without it. An item's cooldown comes as plain
-- numbers: one no longer than the global cooldown is left out, and if the
-- game ever hides them in a fight the watcher keeps what it had. Which of
-- your spells have a cooldown comes from the game data (each spell's base
-- cooldown, ns.COOLDOWNS in Ranks.lua), never from the game in a fight; only
-- the ones you ticked are watched. A cooldown on hold (one that only starts
-- once its effect is used up, like Presence of Mind) isn't counted until it
-- starts: the game says so plainly, and Blizzard's buttons ask the same
-- (ActionButton.lua). Potions share one cooldown: one pulse; trinkets each
-- pulse for their own.
--
-- No pulse for a while after logging in, a reload or a loading screen, nor
-- for a cooldown that never ran: only one the game counted down says it's
-- done. Nor for an item you carry none of now. The pulse is the addon's own
-- plain frame: it never takes the mouse, and shows in a fight like anything
-- that isn't secure. Nothing of Blizzard's is touched.
